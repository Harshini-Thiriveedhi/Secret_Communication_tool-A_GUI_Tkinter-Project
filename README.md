We create a tool with the help of which we can encrypt and decrypt secret messages. 

The interface of this project is built using tkinter.

Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext).
Encryption provide us high security and privacy on our chat/ messages or in sharing any confidential data on any social media .

Decryption is a process of converting encrypted text back to normal text, So the people who have this software and password can readily use it.
